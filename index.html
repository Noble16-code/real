                and so many other people ik. i do not want my relationship to end up being bad and tbh there are a lot of things two people can working on together but for me not being faithful isnt one of them and thats why i said thats
                Obv a relationship isnt gonna be perfect and i am ready to work through anything with you but yea ion when smb aint loyal, and i should have clarified before i said anything.
                Yesterday you just talked about being immature which i dont think this is i think i was just worried. I do think it was really dumb and maybe i lost you cs of that but hopefully i didnt.
